I tried various windows size in the code, and i put a minimum height and widht to the windows size to 400:400
i also tried the usual ratio of screen
- 4:3
640:480
800:600
1024:768
- 16:9
1.280×720 
1.366×768
1.600×900
1.920×1.080

and the most optimal one to use that i find is 20x20 matriks windows to find the non empty windows because 3x3 to 15x15 is kinda small and more than 30 x 30 is too big if we wanted to be precise in detecting the non empty windows, maybe also because
